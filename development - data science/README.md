Data Science program
===============================

The following stages in a Data Science project can be developed inside an R Notebook or script:

- Import
- Tidy
- Transform
- Visualize
- Model 

The *datascience.Rmd* R Notebook contains the analysis.  The work-in-progress can be shared with fellow analysts or business partners inside RStudio Connect: http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/content/813/datascience.nb.html

### Communication

Depending on the audience, this step can covered by an report, dashboard or presentation deck.

- Report - The *communicate.Rmd* contains the source code for the report.  The HTML version can be either emailed, or published to RStudio Connnect: http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/content/814/communicate.html

- Presentation - The *communicate-deck.Rmd* has the source code for a sample presentation.  The deck can be shared in a live presentation, an emailed file, or by sharing a link: http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/content/815/communicate-deck.html#1
