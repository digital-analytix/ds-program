## Project

- The main goal of a Data Science project is to gain insights using data
- The code and development should be loosely goverened.  This will allow maximum agility to obtain answers quickly
- "Tangigle" items that would be passed to the **Production** stage could be: data conversion code, variable selection and model selection.


## Execution

The following stages in a Data Science project can be developed inside an R Notebook or script:

- Import
- Tidy
- Transform
- Visualize
- Model 

The *datascience.Rmd* R Notebook contains the analysis.  The work-in-progress can be shared with fellow analysts or business partners inside RStudio Connect: http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/content/813/datascience.nb.html

### Communication

Depending on the audience, this step can covered by an report, dashboard or presentation deck.

- Report - The *communicate.Rmd* contains the source code for the report.  The HTML version can be either emailed, or published to RStudio Connect: http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/content/814/communicate.html

- Presentation - The *communicate-deck.Rmd* has the source code for a sample presentation.  The deck can be shared in a live presentation, an emailed file, or by sharing a link: http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/content/815/communicate-deck.html#1
