## Project

- Online scoring allows downstream applications, specially those that do not run R, to benefit from the insights gained during analysis
- The `plumber` package can be used to create an API using R
- The code for this project should follow more stringent patterns of development-testing-production 

## Execution

THE REST API can be published in RStudio Connect:
